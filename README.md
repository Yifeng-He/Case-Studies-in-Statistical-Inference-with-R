This project provides a number of case studies on confidence interval estimations and hypothesis tests.

# Confidence Interval Estimation

find_confidence_intervals.R file provides the solutions to a number of practical problems in finding the confidence intervals. The problems are obtained from: http://stattrek.com/tutorials/ap-statistics-tutorial.aspx

The results generated by running find_confidence_intervals.R are shown in find_confidence_intervals.txt.

The list of the problems for confidence interval estimation:

Problem 1: find Confidence interval for a sample mean with t-statistic

Problem 2: find Margin of Error for a sample mean with t-statistic

Problem 3: find Confidence interval for a smaple proportion with t-statistic

Problem 4: find confidence interval for difference between proportions with z-statistic

Problem 5: find confidence interval for difference between means with t-statistic

Problem 6: find confidence interval for difference between means with z-statistic

Problem 7: find confidence interval for mean difference between matched pairs with t-statistic

Problem 8: find confidence interval for the slope of the regression line with t-statistic
